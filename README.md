## Installation

Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system then modifying the .env variables. Register for a Marvel API key and utilise the provided public API key. Remember to include '*' as a referral since you will be accessing the endpoint from localhost.

```bash
npm install 
npm run start
```

## Notes
- The front end was great fun creating a simple autocomplete dropdown. 
- Highlight: Completing the task
- Challenge: 1. API setup 2. I am only grabbing 100 names from the API 
- Furthermore i would 1. grab more names to auto populate the Input. 2. Further style and build out the page.I would also send the front end selection to my postgres api to store it. Then i would display a sort of 'build your own team' where your heros are displayed.
